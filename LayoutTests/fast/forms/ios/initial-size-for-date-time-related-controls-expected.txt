This test verifies that the initial width of date/time-related inputs with no value is equal to the input's width when its value is set to one which would produce the widest possible displayed string for the date or time, and that the displayed value does not overflow onto two lines.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

NOTE: Since the values to check are hardcoded, the values are only certain to produce the widest possible displayed string for locale en_US with 12 hour time.
