PASS Replacing a running animation should get animationcancel earlier than animationstart
PASS The cancel event should be fired before the new start event if both have the same position in the animation list
FAIL The cancel event with an earlier position in animation list should be fired earlier assert_equals: expected "anim" but got "anim2"
FAIL The order of the cancel events follows the relative positions in the animation list at the point when they were cancelled assert_equals: expected "anim2" but got "anim"
