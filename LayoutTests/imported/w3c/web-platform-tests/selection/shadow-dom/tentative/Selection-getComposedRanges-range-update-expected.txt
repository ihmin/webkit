FAIL modify getRangeAt() range: setEnd() crosses shadow boundary into the shadow DOM and after start, which collapses live range. Composed selection range is not collapsed. assert_true: expected true got false
FAIL modify getRangeAt() range: setStart() crosses shadow boundary into the shadow DOM and before end, which collapses live range. Composed selection range is not collapsed. assert_true: expected true got false
FAIL modify getRangeAt() range: setStart() crosses shadow boundary into the shadow DOM and after end, which collapses both live range and composed selection range. assert_true: expected true got false
